## Basics

Start by adding an element with a class of .row. This will create a horizontal block to contain vertical columns. Then add elements with a .column class within that row. You can use .column or .columnsâ€”the only difference is grammar. Specify the widths of each column with the .small-#, .medium-#, and .large-# classes.

Foundation is mobile-first. Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.
