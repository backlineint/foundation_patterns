# Foundation Patterns

The Foundation Patterns theme is a subtheme of [Zurb Foundation](https://www.drupal.org/project/zurb_foundation) intended to implement Foundation components using [UI Patterns](https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns). The primary purpose of this theme is to provide a way to quickly build using common patterns from the [Foundation framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/). Secondarily, it is also intended to provide examples of how to take advantage of patterns defined by the [UI Patterns module](https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns) in a Drupal theme. Support for Pattern Libraries including [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) will also be provided.
